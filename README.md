# Dentally Tech Test [Ruby]

Hello! Thanks for taking part in the Dentally tech test. This repo exists so we have a shared starting point. Take some time to have a look at what's here and check you can run the code.


## Setup

On a recent version of Ruby (we've tested on 3.2), run:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

## What's next?

Full instructions for the task will be handed over at the start of the interview. You shouldn't write any code or attempt the task before the start of the interview. If there are Gems that you anticipate needing then feel free to install them before the interview starts. Good luck!
